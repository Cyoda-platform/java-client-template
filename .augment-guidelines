# Augment Guidelines - Java Client Template

## Project Structure
This is a **Gradle project** using **Spring Boot** with **Cyoda integration**.

## Rules
You must follow the rules given in the @.augment/rules folder.
Some are applied at all times, others are applicable only under certain circumstances.
The file @.augment/rules/README.md will tell you what the scope for each rules .md file is.
Make sure you follow all the rules that are applicable to your current task.

## Package Management
Always use appropriate package managers for dependency management instead of manually editing package configuration files.

1. **Always use package managers** for installing, updating, or removing dependencies rather than directly editing files like package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml, go.mod, etc.

2. **Exception**: Only edit package files directly when performing complex configuration changes that cannot be accomplished through package manager commands.

3. Make sure build/generated-sources/js2p/org/cyoda/cloud/api/event generated classes are available. Use `./gradlew build` to generate them if necessary.
Use these classes for communication with Cyoda.

4. Check example code in `example_code` folder to understand best practices for generating controllers, entities, processors, etc.
