# Pet Store REST API Application - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive pet store REST API application using the Cyoda workflow-driven architecture. The application manages pets, customers, and orders with complete lifecycle workflows and REST endpoints.

## Architecture Summary

### Core Entities Implemented
1. **Pet Entity** - Animals available for adoption/purchase
2. **Customer Entity** - Users who can purchase pets  
3. **Order Entity** - Purchase orders linking customers to pets

### Workflow States and Transitions

#### Pet Workflow
- **States**: initial → available → pending → sold
- **Transitions**: 
  - `register_pet` (automatic): initial → available
  - `reserve_pet` (manual): available → pending  
  - `complete_sale` (manual): pending → sold
  - `cancel_reservation` (manual): pending → available

#### Customer Workflow  
- **States**: initial → active → inactive/suspended → deleted
- **Transitions**:
  - `activate_customer` (automatic): initial → active
  - `deactivate_customer` (manual): active → inactive
  - `reactivate_customer` (manual): inactive → active
  - `suspend_customer` (manual): active → suspended
  - `unsuspend_customer` (manual): suspended → active
  - `delete_customer` (manual): active/inactive/suspended → deleted

#### Order Workflow
- **States**: initial → placed → confirmed → preparing → shipped → delivered
- **Alternative paths**: cancelled, returned
- **Transitions**:
  - `place_order` (automatic): initial → placed
  - `confirm_order` (manual): placed → confirmed
  - `prepare_order` (manual): confirmed → preparing
  - `ship_order` (manual): preparing → shipped
  - `deliver_order` (manual): shipped → delivered
  - `cancel_order` (manual): placed/confirmed/preparing → cancelled
  - `return_order` (manual): delivered → returned

- PaymentValidityCriterion - Validates payment information
- ShipmentReadinessCriterion - Checks if order is ready for shipment

### REST Controllers Implemented (3 total)

#### PetController (/ui/pet/**)
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete pets
- **Search Operations**: Find by status, search by name, advanced search
- **Workflow Operations**: Reserve, sell, cancel reservation
- **Additional**: Change history, business ID lookups

#### CustomerController (/ui/customer/**)
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete customers
- **Search Operations**: List with filtering by status/city
- **Workflow Operations**: Deactivate, reactivate, suspend
- **Additional**: Business ID lookups, username lookups

#### OrderController (/ui/order/**)
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete orders
- **Search Operations**: List with filtering by status/customer/pet
- **Workflow Operations**: Confirm, ship, cancel orders
- **Additional**: Business ID lookups, customer/pet filtering

## Key Features Implemented

### Business Logic
- **Pet Reservation System**: Automatic pet reservation when orders are placed
- **Customer Validation**: Active customer validation for order placement
- **Inventory Tracking**: Pet availability management through workflow states
- **Order Fulfillment**: Complete order lifecycle from placement to delivery
- **Data Integrity**: Proper validation and business rule enforcement

### Technical Features
- **Workflow-Driven Architecture**: All business logic flows through Cyoda workflows
- **Thin Controllers**: Pure proxies to EntityService with no embedded business logic
- **Manual Transitions**: All entity updates use explicit manual transitions
- **Technical ID Performance**: UUIDs in API responses for optimal performance
- **Historical Queries**: Point-in-time data access support
- **Comprehensive Search**: Advanced filtering and search capabilities

## API Endpoints Summary

### Pet Endpoints (15+ endpoints)
- Basic CRUD: POST, GET, PUT, DELETE
- Search: findByStatus, search by name, advanced search
- Workflow: reserve, sell, cancel-reservation
- Utility: change history, business ID operations

### Customer Endpoints (10+ endpoints)  
- Basic CRUD: POST, GET, PUT, DELETE
- Search: list with filtering, search by name/email
- Workflow: deactivate, reactivate, suspend
- Utility: username lookup, business ID operations

### Order Endpoints (12+ endpoints)
- Basic CRUD: POST, GET, PUT, DELETE  
- Search: list with filtering, customer/pet filtering
- Workflow: confirm, ship, cancel
- Utility: business ID operations, status filtering

## Validation Results

### Build Status
✅ **Full Build Successful** - All components compile without errors
✅ **Tests Pass** - All existing tests continue to pass
✅ **Workflow Validation** - All 17 processors and 7 criteria properly implemented

### Compliance Checklist
✅ No modifications to `common/` directory
✅ Proper CyodaEntity interface implementation
✅ Workflow JSON uses "initial" state (not "none")
✅ All transitions have explicit manual flags
✅ Controllers are thin proxies with no business logic
✅ Manual transitions used for all updates
✅ Technical IDs used in API responses

## How to Validate the Implementation

### 1. Build Verification
```bash
./gradlew build
```

### 2. Workflow Validation
```bash
./gradlew validateWorkflowImplementations
```

### 3. API Testing
The application provides REST endpoints for:
- Creating pets, customers, and orders
- Managing entity lifecycles through workflow transitions
- Searching and filtering entities
- Retrieving historical data

### 4. Business Flow Testing
1. Create a customer → should activate automatically
2. Create a pet → should become available automatically  
3. Create an order → should reserve the pet automatically
4. Confirm order → should validate payment and customer
5. Ship order → should complete pet sale
6. Deliver order → should finalize transaction

## Conclusion
The pet store API application has been successfully implemented with:
- **3 core entities** with complete lifecycle management
- **17 processors** handling all business logic
- **7 criteria** enforcing business rules
- **3 REST controllers** providing comprehensive API access
- **Full workflow compliance** with proper state management
- **Clean architecture** following Cyoda best practices

The application is ready for deployment and provides a solid foundation for a production pet store management system.
