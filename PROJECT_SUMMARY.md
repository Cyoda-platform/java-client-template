# Order and Inventory Tracking Service - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This project implements a comprehensive **order and inventory tracking service** for a multi-channel retailer using the Cyoda platform. The system captures structured orders, tracks product stock levels, manages fulfillment, and provides audit and reporting capabilities.

## Architecture

### Core Entities

#### 1. Order Entity
- **Location**: `src/main/java/com/java_template/application/entity/order/version_1/Order.java`
- **Business ID**: `orderId`
- **Key Features**:
  - Multi-channel support (web, store, marketplace)
  - Complete customer information with multiple addresses
  - Line items with product details, pricing, and fulfillment status
  - Payment processing with transaction tracking
  - Shipment tracking with carrier integration and events
  - Comprehensive order lifecycle management

#### 2. InventoryItem Entity
- **Location**: `src/main/java/com/java_template/application/entity/inventory_item/version_1/InventoryItem.java`
- **Business ID**: `productId`
- **Key Features**:
  - Multi-location stock tracking (available, reserved, damaged, in-transit)
  - Product attributes (size, color, batch, expiry date)
  - Reorder point management with supplier integration
  - Comprehensive audit logging for all stock movements
  - Automatic stock level calculations and validations

### Workflow Definitions

#### Order Workflow (`src/main/resources/workflow/order/version_1/Order.json`)
**States**: `initial` → `draft` → `submitted` → `paid` → `packed` → `shipped` → `delivered`
**Terminal States**: `cancelled`, `returned`

**Key Transitions**:
- `submit_order`: Draft → Submitted (with validation)
- `process_payment`: Submitted → Paid (with payment confirmation)
- `pack_order`: Paid → Packed (with inventory reservation)
- `ship_order`: Packed → Shipped (with carrier assignment)
- `deliver_order`: Shipped → Delivered
- `cancel_order`: Available from multiple states
- `return_order`: Available from shipped/delivered states

#### InventoryItem Workflow (`src/main/resources/workflow/inventory_item/version_1/InventoryItem.json`)
**States**: `initial` → `active` → `reorder_needed` / `expired` / `discontinued` → `disposed`

**Key Transitions**:
- `adjust_stock`: Stock level adjustments with audit logging
- `reserve_stock`: Stock reservation for orders
- `release_stock`: Stock release for cancellations
- `check_reorder`: Reorder point evaluation
- `transfer_stock`: Inter-location stock transfers

### Processors (Business Logic)

#### Order Processors
1. **ValidateOrderProcessor**: Validates mandatory fields, calculates totals
2. **ProcessPaymentProcessor**: Handles payment authorization and capture
3. **PackOrderProcessor**: Reserves inventory and deducts stock
4. **ShipOrderProcessor**: Assigns carriers and generates tracking
5. **CancelOrderProcessor**: Releases inventory and processes refunds
6. **DeliverOrderProcessor**: Confirms delivery and updates status
7. **ReturnOrderProcessor**: Handles returns and restocks inventory

#### InventoryItem Processors
1. **StockAdjustmentProcessor**: Manages stock level changes with audit
2. **ReserveStockProcessor**: Handles stock reservations
3. **ReleaseStockProcessor**: Releases reserved stock
4. **ReorderCheckProcessor**: Evaluates reorder needs and triggers alerts
5. **UpdateInventoryItemProcessor**: General item updates and validation

### Criteria (Validation Rules)

#### Order Criteria
1. **OrderValidationCriterion**: Validates order structure and business rules
2. **PaymentConfirmationCriterion**: Confirms payment status and amounts
3. **InventoryAvailabilityCriterion**: Checks stock availability for line items

#### InventoryItem Criteria
1. **StockValidationCriterion**: Validates stock levels and prevents negative stock
2. **StockAvailabilityCriterion**: Checks stock availability for operations
3. **ReorderPointCriterion**: Evaluates reorder point conditions

### REST Controllers

#### OrderController (`/ui/orders`)
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete orders
- **Workflow Actions**: Submit, cancel orders
- **Search Capabilities**: By channel, customer, amount ranges
- **Business ID Lookup**: Find orders by orderId

#### InventoryItemController (`/ui/inventory`)
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete inventory items
- **Stock Operations**: Adjust, reserve, release stock
- **Reorder Management**: Check reorder status
- **Search Capabilities**: By SKU, low stock alerts
- **Business ID Lookup**: Find items by productId

## API Endpoints

### Order Management
- `POST /ui/orders` - Create order
- `GET /ui/orders/{id}` - Get order by technical ID
- `GET /ui/orders/business/{orderId}` - Get order by business ID
- `PUT /ui/orders/{id}?transition=TRANSITION` - Update order with workflow transition
- `POST /ui/orders/{id}/submit` - Submit order for processing
- `POST /ui/orders/{id}/cancel` - Cancel order
- `GET /ui/orders/search?channel=CHANNEL` - Search by channel
- `POST /ui/orders/search/advanced` - Advanced search

### Inventory Management
- `POST /ui/inventory` - Create inventory item
- `GET /ui/inventory/{id}` - Get item by technical ID

## How to Validate the Implementation

### 1. Build Verification
```bash
./gradlew build
```
All components compile successfully and tests pass.

### 2. Workflow Validation
The workflows are properly defined with:
- Correct initial state (`initial` not `none`)
- Proper manual/automatic transition flags
- All processors and criteria referenced in workflows are implemented

### 3. API Testing
Use the REST endpoints to:
- Create orders and inventory items
- Test workflow transitions
- Verify business rule enforcement
- Check audit logging functionality

### 4. Business Rule Validation
- Order totals are calculated correctly
- Inventory is properly reserved and released
- Stock levels prevent overselling
- Audit logs capture all changes

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Architecture Compliance
- ✅ No Java reflection used
- ✅ Interface-based design (CyodaEntity, CyodaProcessor, CyodaCriterion)
- ✅ Thin controllers (pure proxies to EntityService)
- ✅ Manual transitions only for updates
- ✅ Technical IDs used for performance
- ✅ No modifications to `common/` directory

### Data Integrity
- All entities implement proper validation
- Workflow states match JSON definitions
- Processors handle read-only current entity correctly
- Criteria are pure functions without side effects

### Performance Considerations
- Technical UUID lookups for fastest access
- Business ID lookups for user-friendly access
- Efficient search conditions using QueryCondition
- Batch operations where appropriate

## Success Criteria Met
✅ **Full compilation** - `./gradlew build` succeeds  
✅ **Requirements coverage** - All user requirements implemented  
✅ **Workflow compliance** - All transitions follow manual/automatic rules  
✅ **Architecture adherence** - No reflection, thin controllers, proper separation  
✅ **Business logic** - Order lifecycle, inventory management, audit trails  
✅ **API completeness** - CRUD operations, search, workflow actions  

The implementation provides a complete, production-ready order and inventory tracking service that meets all specified functional requirements while adhering to Cyoda platform best practices.
