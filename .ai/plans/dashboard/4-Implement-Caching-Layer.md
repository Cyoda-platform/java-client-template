# Actionable Step: Implement Caching Layer

**Objective:** Add caching functionality to the DashboardServiceImpl to optimize performance and reduce database load.

**Prerequisites:** 
- Actionable Step 3 (Implement Dashboard Data Aggregation Service) must be completed

**Action Items:**
1. Add cache-related constants to DashboardServiceImpl:
   - Define CACHE_TTL_MS constant with value 300000 (5 minutes in milliseconds)
   - Add JavaDoc comment explaining the TTL choice relative to dashboard refresh rate
2. Create CachedDashboardSummary record within DashboardServiceImpl:
   - Add timestamp field (Instant)
   - Add data field (DashboardSummaryDTO)
   - Add isValid() method that checks if current time minus timestamp is less than CACHE_TTL_MS
3. Add cache instance variable to DashboardServiceImpl:
   - Declare ConcurrentHashMap<String, CachedDashboardSummary> cache field
   - Initialize in constructor or as field initializer
   - Use single key "DASHBOARD_SUMMARY" for cache entries
4. Refactor getDashboardSummary() method to use caching:
   - Use cache.compute() method similar to Authentication.java pattern
   - Check if existing cache entry is valid using isValid() method
   - If valid, return cached data
   - If invalid or missing, calculate fresh data
   - Store new CachedDashboardSummary with current timestamp
   - Return the data
5. Extract current calculation logic into private calculateDashboardSummary() method:
   - Move all calculation method calls into this new method
   - Keep error handling within this method
   - Return DashboardSummaryDTO
6. Update getDashboardSummary() to call calculateDashboardSummary() when cache miss occurs:
   - Wrap calculateDashboardSummary() call in cache.compute() lambda
   - Log cache hit vs cache miss events at DEBUG level
   - Log cache refresh events at INFO level
7. Add cache invalidation method (optional for future use):
   - Create public void invalidateCache() method
   - Clear the cache using cache.clear()
   - Log invalidation event
   - Add JavaDoc explaining when this should be called
8. Add logging for cache operations:
   - Log cache hit: "Dashboard summary cache hit"
   - Log cache miss: "Dashboard summary cache miss, calculating fresh data"
   - Log cache refresh: "Dashboard summary cache refreshed, TTL: 5 minutes"
9. Add thread-safety considerations:
   - Ensure ConcurrentHashMap is used for thread-safe operations
   - Verify that cache.compute() provides atomic check-and-update
   - Document thread-safety guarantees in JavaDoc
10. Update class-level JavaDoc to document caching behavior:
    - Explain 5-minute TTL
    - Explain performance benefits (reduces load from 120 to 12 queries/hour)
    - Note that cache is in-memory and not distributed

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- CACHE_TTL_MS constant is defined with correct value and documentation
- CachedDashboardSummary record is created with timestamp, data, and isValid() method
- Cache instance variable is properly initialized using ConcurrentHashMap
- getDashboardSummary() method uses cache.compute() for atomic cache operations
- Cache hit and miss scenarios are handled correctly
- Calculation logic is extracted into separate calculateDashboardSummary() method
- Logging is added for cache operations at appropriate levels
- Cache invalidation method is implemented for future use
- Thread-safety is ensured through proper use of ConcurrentHashMap
- JavaDoc is updated to document caching behavior and performance characteristics
- Code follows the caching pattern established in Authentication.java
