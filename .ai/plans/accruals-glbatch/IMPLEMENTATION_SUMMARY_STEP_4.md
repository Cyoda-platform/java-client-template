## Files Created

### Processor Implementations (6 files)
1. **`src/main/java/com/java_template/application/processor/accrual/DeriveDayCountFractionProcessor.java`**
   - Computes day-count fraction per product convention (ACT_360, ACT_365, THIRTY_360)
   - Runs in SYNC mode
   - Calculates actual days between dates and divides by convention denominator
   - Uses high precision (10 decimal places) for fractions
   - Handles 30/360 day adjustments according to standard rules

2. **`src/main/java/com/java_template/application/processor/accrual/CalculateAccrualAmountProcessor.java`**
   - Calculates interest amount using formula: interestAmount = principal × APR × dayCountFraction
   - Runs in ASYNC_NEW_TX mode on "accruals" calculation nodes
   - Retrieves APR from Loan entity via EntityService
   - Uses 2 decimal places for monetary amounts with HALF_UP rounding
   - Validates all required fields before calculation

3. **`src/main/java/com/java_template/application/processor/accrual/WriteAccrualJournalEntriesProcessor.java`**
   - Writes embedded DR/CR journal entries to $.journalEntries
   - Creates DR entry for INTEREST_RECEIVABLE (debit increases asset)
   - Creates CR entry for INTEREST_INCOME (credit increases revenue)
   - Generates unique entryId for each entry
   - Marks entries as ORIGINAL kind
   - Validates balance (DR total must equal CR total)
   - Runs in ASYNC_NEW_TX mode on ledger nodes

4. **`src/main/java/com/java_template/application/processor/accrual/UpdateLoanAccruedInterestProcessor.java`**
   - Updates loan's accruedInterest balance from net delta of journal entries
   - Uses EntityService to read current loan entity
   - Calculates net delta considering ORIGINAL, REVERSAL, and REPLACEMENT entry kinds
   - Updates loan entity with new accruedInterest balance
   - Uses EntityService to update the loan entity (NOT the current accrual)
   - Runs in ASYNC_NEW_TX mode on ledger nodes

5. **`src/main/java/com/java_template/application/processor/accrual/ReversePriorJournalsProcessor.java`**
   - Appends equal-and-opposite REVERSAL journal entries
   - Queries EntityService for prior accrual using supersedesAccrualId
   - For each ORIGINAL entry in prior accrual, creates REVERSAL entry with opposite direction
   - Sets adjustsEntryId to reference the original entryId
   - Links reversals to originals for audit trail
   - Runs in ASYNC_NEW_TX mode on ledger nodes

6. **`src/main/java/com/java_template/application/processor/accrual/CreateReplacementAccrualProcessor.java`**
   - Creates new Accrual for same asOfDate with corrected data
   - Sets supersedesAccrualId to current accrual's accrualId
   - Copies core fields (loanId, asOfDate, currency, etc.)
   - Sets state to NEW so new accrual goes through full workflow
   - Uses EntityService to create the new accrual entity
   - Runs in ASYNC_NEW_TX mode on "accruals" calculation nodes

## Implementation Details

### Common Patterns
All processors follow the same architectural pattern:

1. **Constructor Injection**
   ```java
   public XxxProcessor(SerializerFactory serializerFactory, EntityService entityService) {
       this.serializer = serializerFactory.getDefaultProcessorSerializer();
       this.entityService = entityService; // Only if needed
   }
   ```

2. **Process Method**
   ```java
   @Override
   public EntityProcessorCalculationResponse process(CyodaEventContext<EntityProcessorCalculationRequest> context) {
       return serializer.withRequest(request)
           .toEntityWithMetadata(Accrual.class)
           .validate(this::isValidEntityWithMetadata, "Invalid accrual entity")
           .map(this::processLogic)
           .complete();
   }
   ```

3. **Supports Method**
   ```java
   @Override
   public boolean supports(OperationSpecification modelSpec) {
       return "ProcessorName".equalsIgnoreCase(modelSpec.operationName());
   }
   ```

4. **Processing Logic**
   ```java
   private EntityWithMetadata<Accrual> processLogic(
           ProcessorSerializer.ProcessorEntityResponseExecutionContext<Accrual> context) {
       EntityWithMetadata<Accrual> entityWithMetadata = context.entityResponse();
       Accrual accrual = entityWithMetadata.entity();
       // Business logic here
       return entityWithMetadata;
   }
   ```

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **EntityService Usage**: Processors that need to interact with OTHER entities use EntityService
   - CalculateAccrualAmountProcessor: Retrieves APR from Loan
   - UpdateLoanAccruedInterestProcessor: Updates Loan accruedInterest
   - ReversePriorJournalsProcessor: Retrieves prior Accrual
   - CreateReplacementAccrualProcessor: Creates new Accrual

2. **Precision and Rounding**:
   - Day count fractions: 10 decimal places with HALF_UP rounding
   - Monetary amounts: 2 decimal places with HALF_UP rounding

3. **Validation**: All processors validate required fields before processing
   - Null checks for entity and metadata
   - Business rule validation (e.g., balance checking)
   - Dependency validation (e.g., dayCountFraction must exist before calculating interest)

4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with descriptive messages
   - IllegalStateException for business rule violations
   - Detailed logging at debug, info, warn, and error levels

5. **Journal Entry Creation**:
   - Unique UUIDs for entryId
   - Proper kind assignment (ORIGINAL, REVERSAL, REPLACEMENT)
   - adjustsEntryId linking for audit trail
   - Balance validation (DR total = CR total)

6. **Net Delta Calculation** (UpdateLoanAccruedInterestProcessor):
   - ORIGINAL/REPLACEMENT: DR increases, CR decreases accrued interest
   - REVERSAL: Opposite effect (DR decreases, CR increases)

## Next Steps

According to the plan file, the next step is:
**Step 5**: Create Accrual Workflow Configuration

This will involve:
- Creating workflow JSON configuration file
- Defining state transitions
- Mapping criteria to transitions
- Mapping processors to transitions
- Importing workflow to Cyoda
- Testing workflow execution

None - all changes were new file additions.

## Dependencies
- Spring Boot 3.5.3
- Jackson for JSON serialization
- SLF4J for logging
- Cyoda Cloud API for event processing
- JUnit 5 and Mockito for testing

## Conclusion
Step 4 is complete. All 6 workflow processors have been implemented, tested, and are ready for integration with the Accrual workflow configuration. The processors provide the necessary business logic for interest calculation, journal entry generation, loan balance updates, and supersedence handling.
