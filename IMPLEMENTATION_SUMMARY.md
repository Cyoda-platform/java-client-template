- `ReviewerAssignmentProcessor` - Handles reviewer assignment logic
- `DecisionProcessor` - Handles approval/rejection decisions

**Criteria**:
- `SubmissionValidationCriterion` - Validates submission data before submission
- `ReviewerValidationCriterion` - Validates reviewer assignment

**Controller**: `SubmissionController` - Full CRUD operations with workflow transitions

### 3. Document Entity

- uploadDate (LocalDateTime) - When document was uploaded
- checksum (String) - File integrity checksum
- filePath (String) - Storage path reference

**Workflow States**: initial_state → uploaded → validated → archived/deleted

**Processors**:
- `DocumentUploadProcessor` - Handles document upload logic
- `DocumentValidationProcessor` - Handles document validation logic

**Criteria**:
- `DocumentPermissionCriterion` - Validates document upload permissions
- `DocumentValidityCriterion` - Validates document content and integrity

**Controller**: `DocumentController` - Full CRUD operations with document management

### 4. Report Entity
**Location**: `src/main/java/com/java_template/application/entity/report/version_1/Report.java`

**Attributes**:
- reportName (String) - Name of the report
- reportType (String) - Type (SUBMISSION_STATUS, USER_ACTIVITY, PERFORMANCE_METRICS)
- generatedBy (String) - Email of user who generated the report
- generationDate (LocalDateTime) - When report was generated
- parameters (String) - JSON string of report parameters
- dataRange (String) - Date range for report data
- format (String) - Report output format (PDF, CSV, JSON)
- filePath (String) - Storage path for generated report file

**Workflow States**: initial_state → generating → completed/failed → archived

**Processors**:
- `ReportGenerationProcessor` - Handles report generation logic
- `ReportCompletionProcessor` - Handles report completion logic

**Criteria**:
- `ReportPermissionCriterion` - Validates report generation permissions
- `ReportParametersCriterion` - Validates report parameters and configuration

**Controller**: `ReportController` - Full CRUD operations with report lifecycle management

## Key Features Implemented

### Business Logic
- User registration and role-based access control
- Submission workflow with reviewer assignment and decision making
- Document upload with version control and validation
- Report generation with configurable parameters and formats

### Validation & Security
- Email format validation across all entities
- Role-based permissions (EXTERNAL_SUBMITTER, REVIEWER, ADMIN)
- File type and size validation for documents
- Data range validation for reports (max 2 years)
- Comprehensive business rule validation in criteria

### API Endpoints
- Full CRUD operations for all entities
- Workflow transition endpoints (activate, submit, approve, reject, etc.)
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Role-based and entity-specific endpoints

### Data Integrity
- UUID-based technical IDs for performance
- Business ID support (email for users, etc.)
- Checksum validation for documents
- Audit trail support through entity metadata

## Validation Results

✅ **WorkflowImplementationValidator**: All processors and criteria successfully validated
- 4 workflow files checked
- 9 processors implemented and found
- 7 criteria implemented and found
- All workflow transitions properly supported

✅ **Build Status**: Full build successful including tests
✅ **Code Quality**: Follows established patterns from examples
✅ **Requirements**: All functional requirements from entity specifications met

## Architecture Compliance

- ✅ No reflection used
- ✅ No modifications to `common/` directory
- ✅ Controllers are thin proxies to EntityService
- ✅ Processors cannot update current entity (read-only)
- ✅ Manual transitions used for updates
- ✅ Proper use of EntityWithMetadata pattern
- ✅ Lombok @Data annotations used consistently
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging

## Next Steps

The implementation is complete and ready for use. All entities support the full workflow lifecycle as defined in the JSON workflow definitions. The system can handle:

1. User registration and management
2. Research/clinical trial submission workflows
3. Document upload and validation
4. Analytics report generation

All components are properly integrated and tested, with comprehensive validation ensuring business rules are enforced at every step.
