  - Available, reserved, damaged, and in-transit stock tracking
  - Automatic reorder point detection
  - Comprehensive audit logging for all stock changes
  - Product attributes (size, color, batch, expiry date)
  - Negative stock prevention
  - Stock level validation

### Workflow Definitions

#### 1. Order Workflow (`Order.json`)
- **Location**: `src/main/resources/workflow/order/version_1/Order.json`
- **States**: Draft → Submitted → Paid → Packed → Shipped → Delivered
- **Alternative States**: Cancelled, Returned
- **Features**:
  - Manual transitions for all state changes
  - Validation criteria at each transition
  - Processor execution for business logic
  - Cancellation and return handling

#### 2. InventoryItem Workflow (`InventoryItem.json`)
- **Location**: `src/main/resources/workflow/inventory_item/version_1/InventoryItem.json`
- **States**: Active → ReorderRequired → Discontinued
- **Features**:
  - Automatic reorder detection
  - Stock adjustment tracking
  - Inventory reservation management

### Business Logic Processors

#### Order Processors (7 total)
1. **SubmitOrderProcessor** - Validates and submits draft orders
2. **PayOrderProcessor** - Processes payments and updates payment status
3. **PackOrderProcessor** - Reserves inventory and prepares for shipping
4. **ShipOrderProcessor** - Assigns carriers and generates tracking numbers
5. **DeliverOrderProcessor** - Confirms delivery and updates status
6. **CancelOrderProcessor** - Handles cancellations with inventory release
7. **ReturnOrderProcessor** - Processes returns with inventory restocking

#### Inventory Processors (4 total)
1. **AdjustStockProcessor** - Handles manual stock adjustments
2. **ReserveInventoryProcessor** - Manages inventory reservations
3. **UpdateInventoryProcessor** - General inventory updates
4. **RestockInventoryProcessor** - Handles inventory restocking

### Validation Criteria

#### Order Criteria (3 total)
1. **OrderValidationCriterion** - Validates order completeness
2. **PaymentValidationCriterion** - Validates payment information
3. **InventoryAvailabilityCriterion** - Checks stock availability

#### Inventory Criteria (2 total)
1. **StockAvailabilityCriterion** - Validates stock levels
2. **ReorderPointCriterion** - Determines reorder requirements

### REST API Controllers

#### 1. OrderController (`/ui/order/*`)
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete orders
- **Search Endpoints**: By channel, customer, order ID
- **Performance Endpoints**: Order summaries with technical IDs
- **State Management**: Workflow transition support

#### 2. InventoryItemController (`/ui/inventory/*`)
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete inventory items
- **Search Endpoints**: By SKU, product ID, reorder status
- **Performance Endpoints**: Inventory summaries
- **Stock Management**: Real-time stock level queries

## Key Features Implemented

- Channel-specific carrier selection
- Unified order processing workflow

### 2. Real-Time Inventory Tracking
- Multi-location stock management
- Real-time availability checking
- Automatic reorder point detection
- Comprehensive audit logging

### 3. Payment Processing
- Multiple payment methods (credit card, PayPal, etc.)
- Payment status tracking with timestamps
- Transaction reference management
- Refund processing for cancellations/returns

### 4. Fulfillment Automation
- Automatic inventory reservation during packing
- Carrier assignment and tracking number generation
- Shipment event tracking
- SLA monitoring capabilities

### 5. Audit and Compliance
- Immutable audit logs for all stock changes
- Complete order lifecycle tracking
- Actor and reason tracking for all changes
- Timestamp tracking for all operations

### 6. Business Rule Validation
- Order total validation
- Inventory availability checking
- Payment amount verification
- Duplicate order prevention
- Negative stock prevention

## How to Validate the Implementation

### 1. Compilation Verification
```bash
./gradlew build
```
This should complete successfully with no errors.

### 2. Workflow Validation
```bash
./gradlew validateWorkflowImplementations
```
This validates that all processors and criteria referenced in workflows are implemented.

### 3. API Testing
The application provides REST endpoints for testing:

#### Order Management
- `POST /ui/order` - Create new order
- `GET /ui/order/{id}` - Get order by technical ID
- `GET /ui/order/business/{orderId}` - Get order by business ID
- `PUT /ui/order/{id}?transition=submit_order` - Submit order
- `GET /ui/order/search/channel/web` - Search orders by channel

#### Inventory Management
- `POST /ui/inventory` - Create inventory item
- `GET /ui/inventory/product/{productId}` - Get by product ID
- `PUT /ui/inventory/{id}?transition=adjust_stock` - Adjust stock
- `GET /ui/inventory/search/reorder-needed` - Find items needing reorder

### 4. Workflow Testing
Test the complete order lifecycle:
1. Create order in Draft state
2. Submit order (Draft → Submitted)
3. Process payment (Submitted → Paid)
4. Pack order (Paid → Packed) - triggers inventory reservation
5. Ship order (Packed → Shipped) - assigns carrier
6. Deliver order (Shipped → Delivered)
