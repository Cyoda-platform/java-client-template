# OMS Backend Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document describes the complete Order Management System (OMS) backend implementation built with Spring Boot and Cyoda integration. The system provides a REST API for managing products, shopping carts, payments, orders, and shipments with workflow-driven business logic.

## Architecture

### Core Components
- **5 Entities**: Product, Cart, Payment, Order, Shipment
- **5 Workflow Definitions**: JSON-based state machines for each entity
- **3 Processors**: Business logic components for cart calculations, payment processing, and order fulfillment
- **4 Controllers**: REST API endpoints for UI integration

### Technology Stack
- **Spring Boot**: Web framework and dependency injection
- **Cyoda**: Workflow engine and entity management
- **Gradle**: Build system
- **Lombok**: Code generation for POJOs
- **Jackson**: JSON serialization

## Implemented Features

### 1. Product Catalog Management
**Entity**: `Product` with complete schema including attributes, localizations, media, variants, inventory, compliance
**Workflow**: Simple active/inactive states
**API Endpoints**:
- `GET /ui/products` - Search and filter products with pagination
- `GET /ui/products/{sku}` - Get full product document by SKU

**Key Features**:
- Free-text search on name/description
- Category filtering
- Price range filtering
- Slim DTOs for list views, full documents for detail views
- Complete product schema with nested structures

### 2. Shopping Cart Management
**Entity**: `Cart` with line items, totals, and guest contact
**Workflow**: NEW → ACTIVE → CHECKING_OUT → CONVERTED
**API Endpoints**:
- `POST /ui/cart` - Create new cart
- `GET /ui/cart/{cartId}` - Get cart details
- `POST /ui/cart/{cartId}/lines` - Add item to cart
- `PATCH /ui/cart/{cartId}/lines` - Update item quantity
- `POST /ui/cart/{cartId}/open-checkout` - Open checkout
- `POST /ui/cart/{cartId}/checkout` - Update guest contact

**Key Features**:
- Automatic total recalculation via `RecalculateTotalsProcessor`
- Stock availability checking
- Guest contact information for anonymous checkout
- Line item management (add/update/remove)

### 3. Payment Processing
**Entity**: `Payment` with dummy provider integration
**Workflow**: INITIATED → PAID/FAILED/CANCELED
**API Endpoints**:
- `POST /ui/payment/start` - Start payment processing
- `GET /ui/payment/{paymentId}` - Poll payment status
- `POST /ui/payment/{paymentId}/cancel` - Cancel payment

**Key Features**:
- Dummy payment auto-approval after 3 seconds via `AutoMarkPaidAfter3sProcessor`
- Payment status polling for UI integration
- Payment cancellation support

### 4. Order Management
**Entity**: `Order` with line items, totals, and customer contact
**Workflow**: WAITING_TO_FULFILL → PICKING → WAITING_TO_SEND → SENT → DELIVERED
**API Endpoints**:
- `POST /ui/order/create` - Create order from paid cart
- `GET /ui/order/{orderId}` - Get order details
- `POST /ui/order/{orderId}/status` - Update order status

**Key Features**:
- Order creation from paid carts via `CreateOrderFromPaidProcessor`
- Automatic stock decrementing
- Short ULID order numbers
- Order status progression for fulfillment

### 5. Shipment Tracking
**Entity**: `Shipment` with line items and quantity tracking
**Workflow**: PICKING → WAITING_TO_SEND → SENT → DELIVERED
**Key Features**:
- Single shipment per order (demo constraint)
- Quantity tracking (ordered/picked/shipped)
- Automatic creation during order processing

## Business Logic Processors

### RecalculateTotalsProcessor
- **Purpose**: Recalculates cart totals when items are added/updated/removed
- **Triggers**: Cart transitions (add_item, decrement_item, remove_item)
- **Logic**: Updates line totals, total items count, and grand total

### AutoMarkPaidAfter3sProcessor
- **Purpose**: Simulates payment processing with 3-second delay
- **Triggers**: Payment transition (auto_mark_paid)
- **Logic**: Sleeps for 3 seconds then marks payment as PAID

### CreateOrderFromPaidProcessor
- **Purpose**: Creates orders from paid carts with stock management
- **Triggers**: Order transition (create_order_from_paid)
- **Logic**: 
  - Snapshots cart data to order
  - Decrements product stock for each item
  - Creates associated shipment in PICKING status

## API Design Principles

### RESTful Design
- All endpoints under `/ui/**` for UI integration
- Proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PATCH)
- Consistent response formats with `EntityWithMetadata<T>`
- Error handling with RFC 7807 ProblemDetail

### Performance Optimization
- Slim DTOs for product list views
- Technical UUID returns for optimal performance
- Pagination support for large datasets
- Efficient search with Cyoda query conditions

### Security & Configuration
- No browser authentication (server-side Cyoda credentials)
- CORS enabled for cross-origin requests
- Swagger UI available at `/swagger-ui/index.html`

## Workflow Configuration

### State Management
- All workflows use "initial" as initial state (not "none")
- Explicit manual/automatic transition flags
- Processor configuration with proper execution modes
- Consistent state progression patterns

### Transition Types
- **Automatic**: System-triggered (create operations)
- **Manual**: User/API-triggered (updates, status changes)
- **Processor-driven**: Business logic execution

## Data Flow Example

### Complete Purchase Flow
1. **Browse Products**: `GET /ui/products?category=electronics`
2. **Create Cart**: `POST /ui/cart`
3. **Add Items**: `POST /ui/cart/{cartId}/lines` (triggers RecalculateTotalsProcessor)
4. **Open Checkout**: `POST /ui/cart/{cartId}/open-checkout`
5. **Add Contact**: `POST /ui/cart/{cartId}/checkout`
6. **Start Payment**: `POST /ui/payment/start` (triggers AutoMarkPaidAfter3sProcessor)
7. **Poll Payment**: `GET /ui/payment/{paymentId}` (until PAID)
8. **Create Order**: `POST /ui/order/create` (triggers CreateOrderFromPaidProcessor)
9. **Track Order**: `GET /ui/order/{orderId}`
