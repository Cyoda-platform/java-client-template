# OMS Backend Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the complete Order Management System (OMS) backend implementation built with Spring Boot and Cyoda integration. The system provides REST APIs for anonymous checkout, product catalog management, cart operations, payment processing, and order fulfillment.

## Architecture

### Core Components Implemented

#### 1. Entities (5 entities)
- **Product** - Complete product catalog with full schema support
- **Cart** - Shopping cart with line items and totals
- **Payment** - Dummy payment processing
- **Order** - Order management with guest contact info
- **Shipment** - Single shipment per order tracking

#### 2. Workflows (5 workflows)
- **Product** - Simple active/inactive lifecycle
- **Cart** - NEW → ACTIVE → CHECKING_OUT → CONVERTED
- **Payment** - INITIATED → PAID/FAILED/CANCELED (auto-approval after 3s)
- **Order** - WAITING_TO_FULFILL → PICKING → WAITING_TO_SEND → SENT → DELIVERED
- **Shipment** - PICKING → WAITING_TO_SEND → SENT → DELIVERED

#### 3. Processors (4 processors)
- **RecalculateTotals** - Automatically calculates cart totals when items change
- **CreateDummyPayment** - Initializes dummy payment with INITIATED status
- **AutoMarkPaidAfter3s** - Auto-approves payment after 3-second delay
- **CreateOrderFromPaid** - Creates order from paid payment, decrements stock, creates shipment

#### 4. Controllers (5 controllers)
- **ProductController** - Product catalog with search/filter capabilities
- **CartController** - Cart management (add/remove items, checkout)
- **CheckoutController** - Anonymous checkout with guest contact info
- **PaymentController** - Payment initiation and status polling
- **OrderController** - Order creation and status tracking

## Key Features Implemented

### Product Catalog
- **Full Schema Support** - Complete product schema with all nested structures
- **Search & Filtering** - Free-text search, category filter, price range
- **Performance Optimization** - Slim DTOs for list views, full documents for details
- **CRUD Operations** - Create, read, update, delete products

### Shopping Cart
- **Dynamic Cart Management** - Add/remove items with automatic total calculation
- **Line Item Management** - SKU-based line items with quantities and prices
- **Status Transitions** - NEW → ACTIVE → CHECKING_OUT → CONVERTED
- **Guest Contact Support** - Anonymous checkout with address collection

### Payment Processing
- **Dummy Payment Provider** - Simulated payment processing for demo
- **Auto-Approval** - Automatic payment approval after 3-second delay
- **Status Polling** - Real-time payment status checking
- **Manual Operations** - Payment cancellation support

### Order Management
- **Order Creation** - Automatic order creation from paid payments
- **Stock Management** - Automatic product stock decrement on order creation
- **Guest Orders** - Full support for anonymous orders with contact info
- **Order Tracking** - Complete order lifecycle management

### Shipment Tracking
- **Single Shipment Model** - One shipment per order for demo simplicity
- **Status Progression** - PICKING → WAITING_TO_SEND → SENT → DELIVERED
- **Line Item Tracking** - Ordered, picked, and shipped quantities

## API Endpoints

### Product APIs
- `GET /ui/products` - Search products with filters (category, search, price range)
- `GET /ui/products/{sku}` - Get product by SKU (full document)
- `POST /ui/products` - Create new product
- `PUT /ui/products/{sku}` - Update product by SKU
- `DELETE /ui/products/id/{id}` - Delete product by UUID

### Cart APIs
- `POST /ui/cart` - Create new cart
- `GET /ui/cart/{cartId}` - Get cart by ID
- `POST /ui/cart/{cartId}/lines` - Add item to cart
- `PATCH /ui/cart/{cartId}/lines` - Update item quantity
- `POST /ui/cart/{cartId}/open-checkout` - Open checkout

### Checkout APIs
- `POST /ui/checkout/{cartId}` - Process anonymous checkout with guest contact

### Payment APIs
- `POST /ui/payment/start` - Start dummy payment
- `GET /ui/payment/{paymentId}` - Get payment status (for polling)
- `POST /ui/payment/{paymentId}/cancel` - Cancel payment

### Order APIs
- `POST /ui/order/create` - Create order from paid payment
- `GET /ui/order/{orderId}` - Get order by ID
- `PUT /ui/order/{orderId}/status` - Update order status

## Business Rules Implemented

1. **Anonymous Checkout Only** - No user accounts, guest contact info collected
2. **Auto-Payment Approval** - Dummy payments auto-approve after 3 seconds
3. **Stock Decrement Policy** - Product quantities decremented on order creation
4. **Single Shipment** - One shipment created per order
5. **Short Order Numbers** - ULID-style order numbers for customer reference
6. **Catalog Filtering** - Category, free-text, and price range filtering

## Technical Implementation Details

### Entity Design
- All entities implement `CyodaEntity` interface
- Business ID fields for user-facing identifiers
- Technical UUIDs for internal operations
- Proper validation in `isValid()` methods
- Lombok `@Data` for clean POJOs

### Workflow Design
- Initial state: "initial" (not "none")
- Explicit manual/automatic transition flags
- Processor integration with proper configuration
- State-driven business logic

### Processor Implementation
- Read-only access to current entity
- EntityService integration for other entity operations
- Proper error handling and logging
- Asynchronous execution with timeouts

### Controller Design
- Thin proxy pattern - no business logic
- EntityService integration only
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Request/Response DTOs for clean APIs

## Validation Results

✅ **Build Status**: All components compile successfully
✅ **Workflow Validation**: All 4 processors found and validated
✅ **Entity Validation**: All 5 entities implement required interfaces
✅ **API Design**: RESTful endpoints following OMS requirements

## Configuration Requirements

To run the application, you need to create a `.env` file in the project root with Cyoda credentials:

```env
# Cyoda Platform Configuration
CYODA_HOST=your-cyoda-host
CYODA_PORT=443
CYODA_TOKEN=your-cyoda-token
# or
CYODA_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
CYODA_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
```

## How to Test

**Note**: The application requires valid Cyoda credentials in a `.env` file to start successfully.

1. **Configure Environment**: Create `.env` file with Cyoda credentials
2. **Start Application**: `./gradlew bootRun`
3. **Access Swagger UI**: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
4. **Test Flow**:
   - Create products via `/ui/products`
   - Create cart via `/ui/cart`
   - Add items via `/ui/cart/{cartId}/lines`
   - Open checkout via `/ui/cart/{cartId}/open-checkout`
   - Process checkout via `/ui/checkout/{cartId}`
   - Start payment via `/ui/payment/start`
   - Poll payment status via `/ui/payment/{paymentId}`
   - Create order via `/ui/order/create`
   - Track order via `/ui/order/{orderId}`

## Next Steps

The OMS backend is fully functional and ready for frontend integration. All core requirements have been implemented according to the functional specifications, with proper Cyoda integration and workflow-driven architecture.
