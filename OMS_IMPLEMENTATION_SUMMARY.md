# Cyoda OMS Backend Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the complete implementation of a **Cyoda Order Management System (OMS) Backend** built with Spring Boot. The application provides REST APIs for a browser UI to manage products, shopping carts, payments, orders, and shipments through Cyoda's workflow-driven architecture.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Entities** - Domain objects implementing `CyodaEntity`
2. **Workflows** - JSON definitions managing entity state transitions
3. **Processors** - Business logic components implementing `CyodaProcessor`
4. **Controllers** - REST API endpoints under `/ui/**`

### Key Design Principles

- **No Java Reflection** - Interface-based design using CyodaEntity/CyodaProcessor
- **Workflow-Driven** - All business logic flows through Cyoda workflows
- **Thin Controllers** - Pure proxies to EntityService with no business logic
- **Manual Transitions** - Entity updates specify manual transitions explicitly
- **Technical ID Performance** - UUIDs in API responses for optimal performance

## Implemented Entities

### 1. Product (`/ui/products`)
- **Full Schema Implementation** - Complete product catalog with attributes, variants, inventory, compliance
- **Business ID**: `sku` (unique product identifier)
- **Key Features**: Multi-level inventory tracking, localization, media management, compliance docs
- **Workflow States**: `initial` → `active`

### 2. Cart (`/ui/cart`)
- **Shopping Cart Management** - Line items, totals, guest contact
- **Business ID**: `cartId`
- **Workflow States**: `initial` → `active` → `checking_out` → `converted`
- **Key Features**: Automatic total recalculation, anonymous checkout support

### 3. Payment (`/ui/payment`)
- **Dummy Payment Processing** - Auto-approval after ~3 seconds
- **Business ID**: `paymentId`
- **Workflow States**: `initial` → `initiated` → `paid|failed|canceled`
- **Key Features**: Automatic payment processing simulation

### 4. Order (`/ui/order`)
- **Order Management** - Customer orders with fulfillment tracking
- **Business ID**: `orderId`
- **Workflow States**: `initial` → `waiting_to_fulfill` → `picking` → `waiting_to_send` → `sent` → `delivered`
- **Key Features**: Cart snapshot, guest contact, short ULID order numbers

### 5. Shipment
- **Shipment Tracking** - Single shipment per order
- **Business ID**: `shipmentId`
- **Workflow States**: `initial` → `picking` → `waiting_to_send` → `sent` → `delivered`
- **Key Features**: Pick/ship quantity tracking

## Implemented Processors

### Cart Processors
- **RecalculateTotals** - Recalculates cart totals and item counts on line changes

### Payment Processors
- **CreateDummyPayment** - Initializes dummy payment with INITIATED status
- **AutoMarkPaidAfter3s** - Automatically marks payment as PAID after ~3 seconds

### Order Processors
- **CreateOrderFromPaid** - Creates order from paid cart, decrements stock, creates shipment

### Product Processors
- **UpdateProductInventory** - Handles product inventory updates

## REST API Endpoints

### Product Management
```
GET    /ui/products                    # Search products with filters
GET    /ui/products/{sku}              # Get product detail (full schema)
POST   /ui/products                    # Create product
PUT    /ui/products/id/{id}            # Update product
```

### Cart Management
```
POST   /ui/cart                        # Create new cart
GET    /ui/cart/{cartId}               # Get cart details
POST   /ui/cart/{cartId}/lines         # Add/increment item
PATCH  /ui/cart/{cartId}/lines         # Update/decrement item
POST   /ui/cart/{cartId}/open-checkout # Open checkout
POST   /ui/cart/checkout/{cartId}      # Add guest contact
```

### Payment Processing
```
POST   /ui/payment/start               # Start dummy payment
GET    /ui/payment/{paymentId}         # Poll payment status
PUT    /ui/payment/{paymentId}/status  # Manual status update
```

### Order Management
```
POST   /ui/order/create                # Create order from paid payment
GET    /ui/order/{orderId}             # Get order details
PUT    /ui/order/{orderId}/status      # Update order status
GET    /ui/order                       # Get all orders
```

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Product Catalog
- **Advanced Search** - Free-text search on name/description, category filter, price range
- **Full Schema Support** - Complete product model with variants, bundles, inventory, compliance
- **Performance Optimization** - Slim DTOs for list views, full documents for detail views

### 2. Shopping Cart
- **Anonymous Checkout** - No user accounts required
- **Automatic Calculations** - Real-time total recalculation via processors
- **Stock Validation** - Prevents adding items exceeding available quantity

### 3. Payment System
- **Dummy Processing** - Auto-approval after 3 seconds for demo purposes
- **Status Polling** - Real-time payment status updates
- **Error Handling** - Support for failed/canceled payments

### 4. Order Fulfillment
- **Cart Snapshotting** - Preserves cart state at order creation
- **Inventory Management** - Automatic stock decrement on order creation
- **Shipment Creation** - Single shipment per order with tracking

### 5. Workflow Integration
- **State Management** - Proper workflow state transitions
- **Processor Integration** - Business logic executed via Cyoda processors
- **Manual Transitions** - Explicit control over entity state changes

## Validation & Testing

### Build Validation
```bash
./gradlew build                        # Full build with tests
./gradlew validateWorkflowImplementations  # Workflow validation
```

### Workflow Validation Results
- ✅ **5 Workflow Files** validated successfully
- ✅ **5 Processors** found and validated
- ✅ **0 Criteria** (none required for this implementation)
- ✅ **All Implementations** match workflow definitions

## Demo Flow (Happy Path)

1. **Browse Products** - `GET /ui/products?category=electronics`
2. **Create Cart** - `POST /ui/cart`
3. **Add Items** - `POST /ui/cart/{cartId}/lines`
4. **Open Checkout** - `POST /ui/cart/{cartId}/open-checkout`
5. **Add Contact** - `POST /ui/cart/checkout/{cartId}`
6. **Start Payment** - `POST /ui/payment/start`
7. **Poll Payment** - `GET /ui/payment/{paymentId}` (wait for PAID)
8. **Create Order** - `POST /ui/order/create`
9. **Track Order** - `GET /ui/order/{orderId}`

## Security & Configuration

- **No Browser Authentication** - All endpoints under `/ui/**` are anonymous
- **Server-Side Credentials** - Cyoda credentials managed server-side
- **CORS Enabled** - Cross-origin requests supported for UI integration
- **Swagger UI** - Available at `/swagger-ui/index.html` for API documentation

## Performance Considerations

- **Technical IDs** - UUIDs used for optimal Cyoda performance
- **Slim DTOs** - Lightweight responses for list endpoints
- **Efficient Queries** - Business ID lookups and search conditions
- **Async Processors** - Non-blocking workflow processing

## Compliance with Requirements

✅ **Anonymous Checkout** - No user accounts required  
✅ **Dummy Payment** - Auto-approval after ~3 seconds  
✅ **Stock Policy** - Decrement on order creation  
✅ **Single Shipment** - One shipment per order  
✅ **Short ULID** - Order numbers generated  
✅ **Catalog Filters** - Category, text search, price range  
✅ **Full Product Schema** - Complete implementation  
✅ **UI APIs Only** - All endpoints under `/ui/**`  

## Next Steps

1. **UI Integration** - Connect frontend application to REST APIs
2. **Data Seeding** - Add sample products for demonstration
3. **Monitoring** - Add logging and metrics for production
4. **Testing** - Comprehensive integration tests
5. **Documentation** - API documentation and user guides

## Conclusion

The Cyoda OMS Backend is fully implemented and ready for integration with a frontend UI. All functional requirements have been met, workflows are validated, and the application builds successfully. The system provides a complete order management solution with product catalog, shopping cart, payment processing, and order fulfillment capabilities.
