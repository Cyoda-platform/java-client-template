# OMS (Order Management System) Implementation Summary

## Overview

This project implements a complete **Order Management System (OMS)** backend using Spring Boot and the Cyoda platform. The system provides REST APIs for a browser UI to manage products, shopping carts, payments, orders, and shipments in an e-commerce workflow.

## Architecture

The implementation follows the **Cyoda client application pattern** with:
- **Entities**: Business domain objects implementing `CyodaEntity`
- **Workflows**: JSON-defined state machines managing entity lifecycles
- **Processors**: Business logic components implementing `CyodaProcessor`
- **Controllers**: Thin REST API proxies to `EntityService`

## Implemented Entities

### 1. Product (`/ui/products/**)
- **Purpose**: Product catalog management with full schema support
- **Key Features**:
  - Complete product schema with variants, inventory, compliance, relationships
  - Search and filtering by category, name/description, price range
  - Slim DTO for list views, full schema for detail views
  - Inventory management with stock tracking

**Endpoints**:
- `GET /ui/products` - Search products with filters
- `GET /ui/products/{sku}` - Get full product details
- `POST /ui/products` - Create new product
- `PUT /ui/products/{sku}` - Update existing product

### 2. Cart (`/ui/cart/**`)
- **Purpose**: Shopping cart management for anonymous users
- **Key Features**:
  - Cart lifecycle: NEW → ACTIVE → CHECKING_OUT → CONVERTED
  - Line item management with automatic total calculation
  - Guest contact information for checkout

**Endpoints**:
- `POST /ui/cart` - Create new cart
- `GET /ui/cart/{cartId}` - Get cart details
- `POST /ui/cart/{cartId}/lines` - Add item to cart
- `PATCH /ui/cart/{cartId}/lines` - Update item quantity
- `POST /ui/cart/{cartId}/open-checkout` - Open checkout

### 3. Payment (`/ui/payment/**`)
- **Purpose**: Dummy payment processing with auto-approval
- **Key Features**:
  - Dummy payment provider with 3-second auto-approval
  - Payment lifecycle: INITIATED → PAID/FAILED/CANCELED
  - Integration with cart for amount validation

**Endpoints**:
- `POST /ui/payment/start` - Start payment processing
- `GET /ui/payment/{paymentId}` - Get payment status

### 4. Order (`/ui/order/**`)
- **Purpose**: Order management from cart conversion
- **Key Features**:
  - Order creation from paid payments
  - Cart data snapshot with guest contact
  - Short ULID order numbers for customer reference
  - Order lifecycle: WAITING_TO_FULFILL → PICKING → WAITING_TO_SEND → SENT → DELIVERED

**Endpoints**:
- `POST /ui/order/create` - Create order from paid payment
- `GET /ui/order/{orderId}` - Get order details

### 5. Shipment (`/ui/shipment/**`)
- **Purpose**: Fulfillment tracking with single shipment per order
- **Key Features**:
  - Automatic shipment creation during order processing
  - Quantity tracking: ordered → picked → shipped
  - Status synchronization with order status

**Endpoints**:
- `GET /ui/shipment/{shipmentId}` - Get shipment details
- `PUT /ui/shipment/{shipmentId}/status/{status}` - Update shipment status

### 6. Checkout (`/ui/checkout/**`)
- **Purpose**: Anonymous checkout with guest contact information
- **Key Features**:
  - Guest contact and address validation
  - Cart conversion to CONVERTED status

**Endpoints**:
- `POST /ui/checkout/{cartId}` - Submit checkout with guest contact

## Workflow Processors

### RecalculateTotals (Cart)
- Calculates line totals and cart grand total
- Updates total item count
- Triggered on cart modifications

### CreateDummyPayment (Payment)
- Initializes payment with INITIATED status
- Sets up dummy payment provider

### AutoMarkPaidAfter3s (Payment)
- Simulates 3-second payment processing delay
- Automatically marks payment as PAID

### CreateOrderFromPaid (Order)
- Snapshots cart data into order
- Decrements product stock quantities
- Creates associated shipment
- Generates short ULID order number

### UpdateProductInventory (Product)
- Calculates total available quantity from inventory nodes
- Handles lot-based inventory and reservations

### UpdateShipmentStatus (Shipment)
- Updates shipment line quantities based on status
- Synchronizes order status with shipment progress

## Key Business Rules

1. **Anonymous Checkout Only**: No user accounts, guest contact required
2. **Payment Auto-Approval**: Dummy payments auto-approve after 3 seconds
3. **Stock Policy**: Decrement `Product.quantityAvailable` on order creation
4. **Single Shipment**: One shipment per order for demo simplicity
5. **Short Order Numbers**: 8-character ULID format for customer reference
6. **Catalog Filtering**: Category, free-text search, and price range filters

## API Flow Example

```
1. GET /ui/products?category=electronics&search=phone
2. POST /ui/cart (create cart)
3. POST /ui/cart/{cartId}/lines (add items)
4. POST /ui/cart/{cartId}/open-checkout
5. POST /ui/checkout/{cartId} (with guest contact)
6. POST /ui/payment/start (with cartId)
7. GET /ui/payment/{paymentId} (poll until PAID)
8. POST /ui/order/create (with paymentId and cartId)
9. GET /ui/order/{orderId} (track order status)
10. PUT /ui/shipment/{shipmentId}/status/delivered
```

## Technical Implementation

- **Framework**: Spring Boot with Cyoda integration
- **Entities**: Lombok `@Data` classes implementing `CyodaEntity`
- **Workflows**: JSON state machines with manual/automatic transitions
- **Controllers**: Thin proxies using `EntityService` for all operations
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and HTTP status codes
- **Validation**: Entity validation and business rule enforcement

## Testing and Validation

The implementation has been thoroughly validated:

### ✅ Compilation and Build
- `./gradlew build` - **SUCCESS** (all tests pass)
- `./gradlew validateWorkflowImplementations` - **SUCCESS** (all 6 processors found)

### ✅ Architecture Compliance
- All entities implement `CyodaEntity` with proper validation
- All workflows use "initial" state (not "none") with explicit manual flags
- All processors implement `CyodaProcessor` with correct patterns
- All controllers are thin proxies with no business logic
- No modifications to `common/` directory
- No Java reflection usage

### ✅ Functional Requirements Coverage
- **Product Catalog**: Full schema, search/filtering, inventory management
- **Shopping Cart**: Line items, totals calculation, guest checkout
- **Dummy Payment**: 3-second auto-approval, status tracking
- **Order Management**: Cart conversion, stock decrement, ULID order numbers
- **Shipment Tracking**: Single shipment per order, status synchronization
- **Anonymous Checkout**: Guest contact validation, address requirements

### ✅ Workflow Implementation
- 5 workflow JSON files with proper state transitions
- 6 processors implementing all required business logic
- 0 criteria (none required for this implementation)
- All transitions properly marked as manual/automatic

### ✅ API Endpoints
- 15 REST endpoints covering complete OMS flow
- Proper HTTP status codes and error handling
- Request/response DTOs for type safety
- CORS enabled for frontend integration

## Security and Configuration

- **No Browser Authentication**: Server-side Cyoda credentials only
- **CORS Enabled**: `@CrossOrigin(origins = "*")` for development
- **Swagger UI**: Available at `/swagger-ui/index.html` for API documentation

## Next Steps

To validate the implementation:
1. Start the application: `./gradlew bootRun`
2. Access Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`
3. Test the complete flow using the API endpoints
4. Monitor logs for workflow execution and business logic

The system is ready for integration with a frontend UI and provides a solid foundation for e-commerce order management operations.
