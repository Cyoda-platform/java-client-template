# Comments Analysis Application - Functional Requirements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the functional requirements implementation for a comments analysis application that ingests data from JSONPlaceholder API, analyzes sentiment, and sends email reports.

## Implemented Entities

### 1. CommentAnalysisRequest
**Purpose**: Represents a request to analyze comments for a specific post ID from JSONPlaceholder API.

**Key Attributes**:
- `postId` (Integer): Post ID to fetch comments for
- `emailAddress` (String): Email address for report delivery
- `requestedAt` (LocalDateTime): Request timestamp

**Workflow States**: initial_state → pending → processing → completed/failed

### 2. CommentAnalysisReport
**Purpose**: Contains analysis results including sentiment analysis and key themes.

**Key Attributes**:
- `postId` (Integer): Analyzed post ID
- `totalComments` (Integer): Number of comments analyzed
- `sentimentSummary` (Map): Counts of positive/negative/neutral sentiments
- `keyThemes` (List): Extracted themes from comments
- `reportGeneratedAt` (LocalDateTime): Report generation timestamp
- `emailAddress` (String): Report recipient email

**Workflow States**: initial_state → generating → completed/failed

## Implemented Processors

### CommentAnalysisRequest Processors
1. **ValidateRequestProcessor**: Validates post ID and email format
2. **FetchCommentsProcessor**: Fetches comments from JSONPlaceholder API
3. **GenerateReportProcessor**: Analyzes comments and creates report entity

### CommentAnalysisReport Processors
1. **SendEmailReportProcessor**: Formats and sends analysis report via email

## Implemented Criteria

### CommentAnalysisRequest Criteria
1. **AnalysisFailedCriterion**: Checks for analysis failures

### CommentAnalysisReport Criteria
1. **EmailFailedCriterion**: Checks for email sending failures

## API Endpoints

### CommentAnalysisRequest Controller
- `POST /api/comment-analysis/requests` - Create new analysis request
- `POST /api/comment-analysis/requests/{uuid}/transitions` - Trigger workflow transitions
- `GET /api/comment-analysis/requests/{uuid}` - Get request status

### CommentAnalysisReport Controller
- `GET /api/comment-analysis/reports/{uuid}` - Get report details
- `GET /api/comment-analysis/reports/by-post/{postId}` - Get reports by post ID

## Workflow Configuration Files
- `src/main/resources/workflow/commentanalysisrequest/version_1/CommentAnalysisRequest.json`
- `src/main/resources/workflow/commentanalysisreport/version_1/CommentAnalysisReport.json`

## Validation Results
✅ All functional requirements validated successfully
- 2 entities implemented
- 4 processors defined and validated
- 2 criteria defined and validated
- All workflow JSON configurations match requirements

## Key Features Implemented
1. **Data Ingestion**: Fetches comments from JSONPlaceholder API by post ID
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Categorizes comments as positive, negative, or neutral
3. **Theme Extraction**: Identifies key themes from comment content
4. **Email Reporting**: Sends formatted analysis reports via email
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive failure handling and retry mechanisms
6. **RESTful API**: Complete REST endpoints for managing requests and viewing reports

## Next Steps
The functional requirements are complete and validated. The next phase would involve implementing the actual Java classes (entities, processors, criteria, and controllers) based on these specifications.
