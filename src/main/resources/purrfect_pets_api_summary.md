# Purrfect Pets API - Implementation Summary

## Overview
The Purrfect Pets API is a comprehensive pet store management system built using the Java Client Template with Cyoda integration. The system manages pets, customers, and orders through workflow-driven state management.

## Architecture
The implementation follows the established Java Client Template patterns with three core entities:

### 1. Pet Entity
- **Purpose**: Manages pets available for adoption/sale
- **Key Attributes**: petId, name, species, breed, age, price, vaccination status
- **Workflow States**: initial_state → available → reserved → adopted/unavailable
- **Processors**: 4 processors for initialization, reservation, adoption completion, and availability management
- **API Endpoints**: Full CRUD operations with state transitions

### 2. Customer Entity  
- **Purpose**: Manages customer registration and verification
- **Key Attributes**: customerId, name, email, address, pet preferences, experience level
- **Workflow States**: initial_state → registered → verified → active/suspended
- **Processors**: 3 processors for registration, verification, and account suspension
- **Criteria**: 1 criterion for customer verification validation
- **API Endpoints**: Registration, profile management, and state transitions

### 3. Order Entity
- **Purpose**: Manages pet adoption/purchase transactions
- **Key Attributes**: orderId, customerId, petId, orderType, amounts, dates, payment status
- **Workflow States**: initial_state → created → processing → payment_pending → confirmed → completed/cancelled
- **Processors**: 5 processors for order lifecycle management
- **Criteria**: 1 criterion for order validation
- **API Endpoints**: Order creation, processing, and status tracking

## Key Features

### Pet Management
- Complete pet lifecycle from availability to adoption
- Support for different species, breeds, and characteristics
- Reservation system to hold pets for customers
- Temporary unavailability for medical or other reasons

### Customer Management
- Registration and verification process
- Profile management with pet preferences
- Account status management (active/suspended)
- Address and contact information tracking

### Order Processing
- End-to-end order workflow from creation to completion
- Payment processing integration points
- Flexible cancellation at multiple stages
- Pickup scheduling and tracking

## Validation Results
✅ **All functional requirements validated successfully**
- 3 entities implemented
- 12 processors defined and validated
- 2 criteria defined and validated
- All workflow JSON configurations match requirements
- Schema validation passed for all workflows

## Next Steps
The functional requirements are complete and validated. The next phase would involve:
1. Implementing the actual Java entity classes
2. Creating processor and criterion implementations
3. Building the REST controllers
4. Writing comprehensive tests
5. Integration with the Cyoda platform

## Technical Specifications
- **Framework**: Spring Boot with Cyoda integration
- **Build Tool**: Gradle
- **Workflow Engine**: Finite State Machine (FSM) based
- **API Style**: RESTful with JSON payloads
- **State Management**: Workflow-driven with automatic and manual transitions
- **Validation**: Built-in functional requirements validator
