Build a Spring Boot client application that exposes simple REST APIs for a browser UI (no login in the browser). The app will hold server-side Cyoda credentials and talk to Cyodaâ€™s standard /entity/ APIs and workflows on behalf of the UI. Key demo rules include anonymous checkout only, dummy payment auto-approval, stock policy adjustments, single shipment per order, and catalog filters.
