# Processors Requirements

## Overview
Processors handle the business logic for sending happy and gloomy mails. Each processor is responsible for the actual mail sending functionality for their respective mail types.

## MailSendHappyMailProcessor

### Entity
Mail

### Purpose
Processes and sends happy mail to the recipients in the mail list.

### Expected Input Data
- Mail entity with `isHappy = true`
- Mail entity with valid `mailList` containing email addresses
- Entity must be in `HAPPY_PROCESSING` state

### Business Logic (Pseudocode)
```
FUNCTION process(mailEntity):
    // Validate input
    IF mailEntity.isHappy != true THEN
        THROW ValidationException("Mail is not marked as happy")
    END IF
    
    IF mailEntity.mailList is empty THEN
        THROW ValidationException("Mail list cannot be empty")
    END IF
    
    // Prepare happy mail content
    SET subject = "Happy Mail - Spreading Joy!"
    SET content = "Hello! We hope this message brings a smile to your face. Have a wonderful day filled with happiness and joy!"
    
    // Send mail to each recipient
    FOR EACH email IN mailEntity.mailList:
        TRY:
            CALL emailService.sendMail(email, subject, content)
            LOG "Happy mail sent successfully to: " + email
        CATCH EmailException:
            LOG "Failed to send happy mail to: " + email
            THROW ProcessingException("Failed to send mail to " + email)
        END TRY
    END FOR
    
    LOG "All happy mails sent successfully"
    RETURN mailEntity (unchanged)
END FUNCTION
```

### Expected Output
- Mail entity remains unchanged (state transition handled by workflow)
- Happy mails sent to all recipients in the mail list
- Logs successful mail sending operations

### Side Effects
- Sends emails to external recipients
- Creates audit logs for mail sending operations

### Error Handling
- Throws ProcessingException if any mail fails to send
- Validates input data before processing

## MailSendGloomyMailProcessor

### Entity
Mail

### Purpose
Processes and sends gloomy mail to the recipients in the mail list.

### Expected Input Data
- Mail entity with `isHappy = false`
- Mail entity with valid `mailList` containing email addresses
- Entity must be in `GLOOMY_PROCESSING` state

### Business Logic (Pseudocode)
```
FUNCTION process(mailEntity):
    // Validate input
    IF mailEntity.isHappy != false THEN
        THROW ValidationException("Mail is not marked as gloomy")
    END IF
    
    IF mailEntity.mailList is empty THEN
        THROW ValidationException("Mail list cannot be empty")
    END IF
    
    // Prepare gloomy mail content
    SET subject = "Thoughtful Message - A Moment of Reflection"
    SET content = "Hello. Sometimes life brings challenges and difficult moments. Remember that it's okay to feel down sometimes, and brighter days are ahead. Take care of yourself."
    
    // Send mail to each recipient
    FOR EACH email IN mailEntity.mailList:
        TRY:
            CALL emailService.sendMail(email, subject, content)
            LOG "Gloomy mail sent successfully to: " + email
        CATCH EmailException:
            LOG "Failed to send gloomy mail to: " + email
            THROW ProcessingException("Failed to send mail to " + email)
        END TRY
    END FOR
    
    LOG "All gloomy mails sent successfully"
    RETURN mailEntity (unchanged)
END FUNCTION
```

### Expected Output
- Mail entity remains unchanged (state transition handled by workflow)
- Gloomy mails sent to all recipients in the mail list
- Logs successful mail sending operations

### Side Effects
- Sends emails to external recipients
- Creates audit logs for mail sending operations

### Error Handling
- Throws ProcessingException if any mail fails to send
- Validates input data before processing

### Transition Information
- Both processors do not trigger additional entity transitions
- State transitions are handled automatically by the workflow after successful processing
- If processing fails, the workflow will transition to FAILED state
