Great! To clarify your requirements, letâ€™s define the key entities and their workflows based on your description. Here are three entities that seem relevant:

1. **HN Item**
   - **Workflow:** Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations for individual HN items. This includes posting single items, arrays, and bulk uploads.

2. **HN Item Bulk Upload**
   - **Workflow:** Handle bulk uploads of HN items in a JSON file format.

3. **HN Item Search**
   - **Workflow:** Execute search queries for HN items, including hierarchical joins to parent items.
