Thank you for providing the reference along with your user stories for the 'Purrfect Pets' API app! Let's flesh out the functionality a bit more based on your requirements:

1. **Viewing Available Pets**:
   - **User Story**: *As a user, I want to view a list of available pets, so I can choose one that I like.*
     - **Response**: The app should present a comprehensive list of pets with key details displayed, such as:
       - Pet name
       - Type (cat, dog, etc.)
       - Age
       - A thumbnail image
       - A short description.

2. **Filtering Pets by Type**:
   - **User Story**: *As a user, I want to filter pets by type (like cats, dogs, etc.), so I can find my ideal pet easily.*
     - **Response**: The app should include filter options on the interface. Users should be able to select a pet type (for example, "Cats" or "Dogs"), and the displayed list should update to show only those pets that match the selected type.

3. **Additional Features**:
   - Do you have any other functionalities in mind? For instance:
     - Would you like to include a search bar for users to find specific breeds?
     - Should there be an option for users to save their favorite pets to a personal list?
