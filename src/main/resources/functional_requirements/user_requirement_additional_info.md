Thank you for sharing the API data contracts for your MVP scope! It looks like you have a structured approach in mind. Let’s delve deeper into the functionalities based on these contracts. Here are some aspects to consider:

### 1. **Submission Creation**
You mentioned the creation of submissions. What specific fields are most critical for your users when submitting documents? 

Example User Story:
```markdown
As a researcher, I want to create a submission with all necessary metadata, so that I can ensure compliance and regulatory requirements are met.
```

### 2. **Adverse Events (AE) Reporting**
The AE structure you provided is quite detailed. What types of adverse events are most relevant for your platform? Do you envision any additional fields or functionalities for tracking these events?

Example User Story:
```markdown
As a clinician, I want to report adverse events swiftly, so that I can contribute to patient safety and regulatory compliance.
```

### 3. **Error Handling**
Considering your common error model, how do you expect the system to respond to validation failures or conflicts? Would you like to provide users with specific guidance on how to correct their submissions?

Example User Story:
```markdown
As a user, I want to receive detailed error messages when my submission fails, so that I can quickly correct the issues and resubmit.
```

### 4. **Idempotency and Security**
You’ve indicated the use of idempotency keys and role-based access control (RBAC). How do you envision managing user roles and permissions? 

Example User Story:
```markdown
As an admin, I want to manage user roles effectively, so that I can control access to sensitive data and functionalities.
```
