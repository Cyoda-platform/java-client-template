This is a comprehensive outline for your Integrated Digital Platform for Research & Clinical Trial Management! It's clear that you're aiming for a phased approach with a focus on delivering a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) first. Let’s dive deeper into the functionalities you have in mind. 

Here are some questions to help clarify your needs:

1. **User Roles & Permissions**: You mentioned Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). What specific roles do you envision, and what permissions should each role have?

2. **Clinical Trial Management**: What key features do you want in the Clinical Trial Management System (CTMS)? For example, do you need functionalities for tracking patient enrollment, managing timelines, or monitoring trial progress?

   Example User Story:  
   ```markdown
   As a trial coordinator, I want to track patient enrollment status, so that I can ensure we meet our recruitment goals.
   ```

3. **Data Capture and Reporting**: What types of data collection and reporting functionalities do you foresee? Do you need customizable Case Report Forms (CRFs)?

   Example User Story:  
   ```markdown
   As a data manager, I want to generate reports on trial progress and patient outcomes, so that I can analyze the effectiveness of the trial.
   ```

4. **Integration Needs**: You mentioned TBDs for integration partners. Are there specific systems or APIs you anticipate needing to connect with?
