Let's explore the functionality for your 'Purrfect Pets' API app using the Petstore API data. Here are some points to consider:

1. **User Stories**:
   - **As a user**, I want to see a list of pets available for adoption, so I can browse through them easily.
   - **As a user**, I want to filter pets by criteria such as breed or size, to help narrow down my choices.
   - **As a user**, I want to view detailed information about a specific pet when I click on it, so I can learn more about its personality and needs.

2. **Interactions**:
   - How would you like users to interact with the app? For example:
     - Should users be able to create profiles to save their favorite pets?
     - Would you like a feature to allow users to leave reviews or feedback on pets?

3. **Pet Information**:
   - What details about each pet do you want to display? For instance:
     - Name, age, breed, a short description, and perhaps a photo?

4. **Additional Features**:
   - Are there any other features you want? Such as:
     - A search bar for users to find specific pets?
     - An option for users to share pet profiles on social media platforms?
