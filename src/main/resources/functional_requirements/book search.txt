\f0\fs24 \cf0 Book Search and Recommendation Application\
Hello! I\'92d like to build an application that searches for books using the Open Library API https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/search. The application should include:\
\
Data Ingestion: Fetch search results for books based on user queries from the Open Library API.\
Data Display: Display a list of search results along with book details (title, author, cover image).\
User Interaction: Allow users to filter results by genre, publication year, and author.\
Reporting: Generate weekly reports on the most searched books and user preferences.\
Recommendations: Provide personalized book recommendations based on users' previous searches.\
Data ingestion should occur daily to keep the book database updated.}
